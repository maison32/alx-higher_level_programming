solves tasks based on 
writting  empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle
Writtin a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by  constructor must take 2 arguments w and h Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
by using use the class notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object to construct a rectangle
solving and constructing a rectangle using  must use the class notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X 
and other more tasks on  this project.
